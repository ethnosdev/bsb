# Contributing to the Berean Standard Bible app

This is an open-source project and code contributions are welcome. EthnosDev values making God's word freely available to everyone and [removing any hindrances to sharing it](https://sellingjesus.org/articles/copyright-and-the-bible). To that end, the code for this app has been dedicated to the public domain ([CC0](https://github.com/ethnosdev/bsb/blob/master/LICENSE)). By contributing to this project, you are agreeing to release your contributions to the public domain as well.

## What to work on

Reporting bugs is very useful. Open an [issue](https://github.com/ethnosdev/bsb/issues) and describe the bug with enough detail to reproduce it. Specific examples or screenshots are often useful to make the problem clear.

The [road map](https://github.com/ethnosdev/bsb/wiki) shows the general direction for the app. However, instead of directly taking a feature from there, let's spend some time discussing it in the issues section first. That way we can make sure we are headed in the same direction and your work doesn't get wasted. If we ever decide that we're not going in the same direction for the app, you are always welcome to clone the project and publish your own version.

## Making a pull request

Before making a PR, there should be a related GitHub issue that you can reference in the PR. That's where we can clarify what the exact problem or desired feature is. 

Generally, small PRs are easier to review and merge than large ones. However, if we've already discussed a larger feature, then these are also OK, especially if the PR only modifies a single folder.

If the PR affects the UI, including before and after screenshots with red circle annotations (if needed) is often very useful. Even if the PR doesn't affect the UI, a text summary of the changes is helpful in the description.
